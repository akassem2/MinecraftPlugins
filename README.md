# MinecraftPlugins
This is a repository to store all the code I make and everything I learn going through the Udemy course by Stephen King, Develop Minecraft Plugins (Java). As I follow along the 34 hour long course, I'm delving deep into Java and the many ways you can interact with it through the Plugins, and learning additional things along the way.
